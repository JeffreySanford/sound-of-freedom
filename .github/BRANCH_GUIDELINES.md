# Branch Naming & Guidelines

Recommended branch naming conventions:

- `feature/<short-description>` (e.g., feature/add-jen1-elliptic)
- `bugfix/<short-description>`
- `chore/<short-description>`
- `hotfix/<short-description>`

PR checklist
- Ensure CI passes, including platform-specific checks.
- MD Lint: `pnpm run lint:md` must pass

Notes
- Name branches descriptively and reference relevant issue IDs when applicable.
